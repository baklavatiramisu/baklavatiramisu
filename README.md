## Hello ðŸ‘‹

I am `@baklavatiramisu`, CompSci student interested in learning Java, 
Spring Boot, Angular and GenAI. I keep learning new things every day,
and I used to keep mycoding works open here. Feel free to learn with
me! If you are an experienced person in these domains, I really
appreciate to review my coding works, and I welcome suggestions,
criticisms and even roasts!

### About my workstation

I used to work on my Lenovo ThinkPad P14s running RedHat Linux. I am a
great fan of ThinkPads because I love the way it looks, the red trackpoint,
durability and the vibrant ThinkPad community!

Follow my `@thinkpadian` account for my ThinkPad show-offs!
